• There are 𝑀 shelves in a large warehouse 1, 2, . . . , 𝑀 in which the shelf 𝑗 is
located at point j of the warehouse (𝑗 = 1, … , 𝑀).
• There are 𝑁 product 1, 2, . . . , 𝑁. The amount of product 𝑖 in the shelf 𝑗 is 𝑄[𝑖][𝑗].
• The warehouse staff starts from the door (point 0) of the warehouse, and want to
visit some shelves
• (each shelf is visited at most once) and come back to the door to pickup products
for the order of customers in which the total amount of product 𝑖 he must pickup is
𝑞[𝑖] (𝑖 = 1, 2, . . . , 𝑁).
• The travel distance from point i to point 𝑗 is 𝑑(𝑖, 𝑗) (0 ≤ 𝑖, 𝑗 ≤ 𝑀).
• Find the sequence of shelves to visit such that the total travel distance is minimal.

• Input
• Line 1: two positive integer 𝑁 and 𝑀 (1 ≤ 𝑁 ≤ 50, 1 ≤ 𝑀 ≤ 1000)
• Line 1 + 𝑖 (𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑁): contains the ith row of 𝑄
• Line 𝑁 + 𝑖 + 2 (𝑖 = 0, 1, … , 𝑀): contains the ith row of the distance matrix 𝑑
• Line N + M + 3: contains 𝑞[1], 𝑞[2], . . . , 𝑞[𝑁]
A solution is represented by a sequence of 𝑁 positive integers
𝑥1, 𝑥2, . . . , 𝑥𝑁 representing the sequence of shelves to be visited
• Output
• Line 1: contains a positive integer 𝑁
• Line 2: contains n positive integers 𝑥1, 𝑥2, . . . , 𝑥𝑁
